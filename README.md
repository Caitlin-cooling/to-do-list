# To Do List App

This is a basic to do list app built using react. A user can currently create a to do and a confirmation message is rendered when they do so.

Please note that this is spiked as it is a learning exercise in React. I plan to complete this again fully test driven.

### Using the App
1. `git clone https://github.com/Caitlin-cooling/to-do-list.git`
2. `cd to-do-list`
3. Open the `index.html` file in your browser

### Known Issues
* I would like to be able to move the rendering of the submit input along with the handleClick event handler to its' own component
